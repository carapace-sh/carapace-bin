# v0.15 - Porcelain Shop

## ZSH (this might break some stuff)

Added support for homedir (`~`) and [static named directories](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Static-named-directories).
These are not expanded by zsh for the completion function are thus now handled by carapace.
Quoting of special characters is now also done in carapace instead of [compadd](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Completion-Widgets.html#Completion-Builtin-Commands) to skip `~` at appropriate times.
Edge cases where this doesn't work and some initial bugs regarding special characters not yet being handled correctly are expected.
