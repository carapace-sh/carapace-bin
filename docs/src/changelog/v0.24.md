# v0.24 - Spring Cleaning

![](./v0.24/banner.png)

## carapace-bridge

Moved bridge actions to [carapace-bridge].
The shell bridges now use custom configs at  [`${UserConfigDir}/carapace/bridge`]
(e.g. `~/.config/carapace/bridge/fish/config.fish` instead of `~/.config/fish/config.fish`).

## removed flags

Removed `--bridge` and `--spec` flags as user specs are preferred and there are [carapace-bridge] and [carapace-spec] as well.
