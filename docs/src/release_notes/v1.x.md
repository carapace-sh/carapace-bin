## Fish

With [4.0b1](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/4.0b1) onwards the following workaround is not needed anymore:
```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
carapace --list | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -I{} touch ~/.config/fish/completions/{}.fish # disable auto-loaded completions (#185)
```
